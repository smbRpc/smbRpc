This is a Windows RPC over SMB namepipe library modeled over the ruby_smb library.
All function names and arguments were written to closely reflct the originals MS documented specifications.             
Currently I have only exposed some functions to the following namepipes.  I'll be adding more as I continue developing this project.  

epmapper
samr
srvsvc
svcctl
lsarpc
